# T-CRON-01 — Nightly Jobs Infrastructure & Scheduled Tasks

**Status**: 🔒 Blocked (T15 should merge first — most jobs operate on finalized invoices)
**Phase**: Cross-cutting
**Requires**: T15 (payments) merged for meaningful overdue detection; pg-boss setup can start earlier
**Blocks**: nothing strictly, but T17 should be absorbed into this ticket

---

## What & Why

BON needs a background job system for scheduled maintenance and compliance tasks. PLAN.md chose **pg-boss** (PostgreSQL-backed job queue) — no new infrastructure needed. This ticket sets up the pg-boss infrastructure and implements all nightly/scheduled jobs in one place, rather than scattering cron setup across multiple tickets.

**Absorbs T17** (Overdue Detection) — overdue detection is one nightly job among several. Having a separate ticket for it means pg-boss setup gets done in T17 but the other jobs are orphaned. Better to do all scheduled tasks together.

## Part 1: pg-boss Infrastructure

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `pg-boss` installed and configured in `api/src/jobs/boss.ts`
- [ ] Boss instance starts with the Fastify server (plugin at `api/src/plugins/jobs.ts`)
- [ ] Graceful shutdown: `boss.stop()` on server close
- [ ] Job handlers registered at startup
- [ ] Cron schedule table (all times in Israel timezone, `Asia/Jerusalem`):

| Job Name | Schedule | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `overdue-detection` | `0 6 * * *` (6:00 AM daily) | Mark overdue invoices, send digest |
| `draft-cleanup` | `0 3 * * *` (3:00 AM daily) | Delete abandoned drafts |
| `session-cleanup` | `0 4 * * *` (4:00 AM daily) | Purge expired sessions |
| `shaam-token-refresh` | `*/15 * * * *` (every 15 min) | Refresh expiring SHAAM tokens |

- [ ] Each job has error handling: catch, log, do not crash the server
- [ ] Each job logs start/end/duration for observability
- [ ] `npm run check` passes

### Architecture Notes

```typescript
// api/src/jobs/boss.ts
import PgBoss from 'pg-boss';

export function createBoss(connectionString: string): PgBoss {
  return new PgBoss({
    connectionString,
    schema: 'pgboss', // separate schema, does not pollute public
  });
}

// api/src/plugins/jobs.ts — Fastify plugin
export const jobsPlugin: FastifyPluginAsync = async (app) => {
  const boss = createBoss(app.config.DATABASE_URL);
  await boss.start();

  // Register cron schedules
  await boss.schedule('overdue-detection', '0 6 * * *', null, { tz: 'Asia/Jerusalem' });
  await boss.schedule('draft-cleanup', '0 3 * * *', null, { tz: 'Asia/Jerusalem' });
  await boss.schedule('session-cleanup', '0 4 * * *', null, { tz: 'Asia/Jerusalem' });
  await boss.schedule('shaam-token-refresh', '*/15 * * * *', null, { tz: 'Asia/Jerusalem' });

  // Register handlers
  await boss.work('overdue-detection', handleOverdueDetection);
  await boss.work('draft-cleanup', handleDraftCleanup);
  await boss.work('session-cleanup', handleSessionCleanup);
  await boss.work('shaam-token-refresh', handleShaamTokenRefresh);

  app.addHook('onClose', async () => {
    await boss.stop();
  });

  app.decorate('boss', boss); // for on-demand job enqueue (e.g., SHAAM allocation)
};
```

**On-demand jobs** (not cron — enqueued by other features):
- `shaam-allocation-request` — enqueued by finalization when SHAAM is required (T13)
- `send-invoice-email` — enqueued by "send" action (T11)
- `generate-pdf` — enqueued by PDF request (T10)

These on-demand job handlers are NOT implemented in this ticket — they're registered by their respective tickets. This ticket only sets up the boss instance and the cron jobs.

## Part 2: Overdue Detection (absorbs T17)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Runs daily at 6:00 AM Israel time
- [ ] Finds all invoices where: `status IN ('finalized', 'sent', 'partially_paid')` AND `dueDate < NOW()` AND `dueDate IS NOT NULL` AND `isOverdue = false`
- [ ] Sets `isOverdue = true` on each (batch UPDATE, not one-by-one)
- [ ] Also resets `isOverdue = false` for invoices that were overdue but are now paid (handles edge case where payment recorded after overdue flag set)
- [ ] Sends digest email to each business owner with overdue invoices (requires T11 email infrastructure — if not yet available, log instead)
- [ ] Digest groups invoices by business, shows: invoice number, customer name, amount, days overdue
- [ ] Idempotent: running twice in the same day produces the same result

### Handler

File: `api/src/jobs/handlers/overdue-detection.ts`

```typescript
async function handleOverdueDetection(): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Batch-mark newly overdue
  await db.update(invoices)
    .set({ isOverdue: true, updatedAt: new Date() })
    .where(and(
      inArray(invoices.status, ['finalized', 'sent', 'partially_paid']),
      lt(invoices.dueDate, sql`CURRENT_DATE`),
      isNotNull(invoices.dueDate),
      eq(invoices.isOverdue, false),
    ));

  // 2. Reset overdue flag for paid invoices
  await db.update(invoices)
    .set({ isOverdue: false, updatedAt: new Date() })
    .where(and(
      eq(invoices.status, 'paid'),
      eq(invoices.isOverdue, true),
    ));

  // 3. Collect overdue invoices grouped by business for digest
  // 4. Send digest email per business owner (or log if email not available)
}
```

## Part 3: Draft Cleanup

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Runs daily at 3:00 AM Israel time
- [ ] Deletes draft invoices where `updatedAt < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'` AND `status = 'draft'`
- [ ] Hard delete (cascade deletes items)
- [ ] Logs count of deleted drafts per business
- [ ] Does NOT delete drafts that have been touched in the last 30 days
- [ ] Idempotent

### Handler

File: `api/src/jobs/handlers/draft-cleanup.ts`

```typescript
async function handleDraftCleanup(): Promise<void> {
  const cutoff = new Date();
  cutoff.setDate(cutoff.getDate() - 30);

  const deleted = await db.delete(invoices)
    .where(and(
      eq(invoices.status, 'draft'),
      lt(invoices.updatedAt, cutoff),
    ))
    .returning({ id: invoices.id, businessId: invoices.businessId });

  if (deleted.length > 0) {
    logger.info({ count: deleted.length }, 'Cleaned up abandoned drafts');
  }
}
```

---

## Part 4: Session Cleanup

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Runs daily at 4:00 AM Israel time
- [ ] Deletes sessions where `expiresAt < NOW()`
- [ ] Logs count of purged sessions
- [ ] Idempotent

### Notes

Sessions are already validated on access (expired sessions are rejected), so stale rows are not a security issue — they just waste space. This is a housekeeping job. Referenced in T-API-01 as a low-urgency item.

---

## Part 5: SHAAM Token Refresh

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Runs every 15 minutes
- [ ] Finds all `business_shaam_credentials` rows where `tokenExpiresAt < NOW() + INTERVAL '5 minutes'`
- [ ] For each: attempt to refresh the token via SHAAM OAuth2 refresh flow
- [ ] On success: update `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `tokenExpiresAt`
- [ ] On failure: log error, mark business as needing re-authorization (set a flag or send notification to business owner)
- [ ] Does not block or fail other businesses if one refresh fails

### Notes

This job depends on SHAAM integration (T12). The handler skeleton can be created in this ticket with a TODO, and the actual refresh logic wired in when T12 ships. Alternatively, defer the handler registration entirely until T12 — just have the cron schedule ready.

---

## Test Strategy

- **pg-boss setup**: Integration test that starts boss, enqueues a test job, verifies it runs
- **Overdue detection**: Unit test with pg-mem — insert invoices with various statuses and due dates, run handler, verify `isOverdue` flags
- **Draft cleanup**: Unit test — insert old and recent drafts, run handler, verify only old ones deleted
- **Session cleanup**: Unit test — insert expired and valid sessions, run handler, verify only expired ones deleted
- **SHAAM token refresh**: Deferred to T12
